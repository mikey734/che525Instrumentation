FIT525A (Coriolis Flowmeter): The Coriolis flow meter measures the mass flow rate of a fluid and was successfully installed and connected to the control system without any issues.

PIT525A (Pressure transmitter): The pressure transmitter measures the pressure of a fluid and required drivers to be installed for it to work properly with the control system, but after some initial difficulty, it was able to communicate with the system.

LIT525A (Level sensor): The level sensor measures the level of a fluid in a vessel and also required drivers to be installed for it to work with the control system, but after some initial difficulty, it was able to communicate with the system and was named using the device's screen.

TE525A (RTD): The RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) measures temperature using a Platinum-100 metal and was successfully installed and connected to the control system without any issues, but when read on the digital interface, it is referred to as DST-TE525A.
